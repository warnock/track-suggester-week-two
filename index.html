          <h2>Java/Android Track</h2>
          <p><span class="firstName text-info"></span>, Java is a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.</p>
          <p>In <span class="city text-info"></span>, there are some good coding school options for this track. Click <a href="#">here</a> to find the right one for you!</p>
          <p>No matter what track appeals to you the most important thing is to get the basic principles of coding down, practice a lot, and be ready to change to another language when your job inevitably does.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="cssDesignTrack">
          <h2>CSS/Design Track</h2>
          <p><span class="firstName text-info"></span>, one of the first things you will need to decide is if you want to focus more on front-end or back-end development. Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take CSS and Design classes.</p>

        <div id="phpDrupalTrack">
          <h2>PHP/Drupal Track</h2>
          <p><span class="firstName text-info"></span>, PHP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, PHP is a great direction to go.</p>
